ChatGPT:
It looks like there might be a typo in your code. The correct function to use is `case_when`, not `case_match`. Here's the corrected code:

```R
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(age_group = case_when(
    age_group == "Aged 17 years and younger" ~ "Under 17 years",
    age_group == "Aged 17 years and under" ~ "Under 17 years",
    TRUE ~ age_group  # Keep the original value if it doesn't match any condition
  ))
```

In this code, `case_when` is used to create conditions for updating the "age_group" column, and it correctly checks for both "Aged 17 years and younger" and "Aged 17 years and under" conditions. The `TRUE ~ age_group` part ensures that if none of the specified conditions match, the original value is retained. Adjust it according to your specific needs.
