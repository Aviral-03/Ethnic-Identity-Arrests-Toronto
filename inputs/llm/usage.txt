    age_group,
    "Aged 17 years and younger" ~ "Under 17 years",
    "Aged 17 years and under" ~ "Under 17 years"
  ))

ChatGPT:
It looks like there might be a typo in your code. The correct function to use is `case_when`, not `case_match`. Here's the corrected code:

```R
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(age_group = case_when(
    age_group == "Aged 17 years and younger" ~ "Under 17 years",
    age_group == "Aged 17 years and under" ~ "Under 17 years",
    TRUE ~ age_group  # Keep the original value if it doesn't match any condition
  ))
```

In this code, `case_when` is used to create conditions for updating the "age_group" column, and it correctly checks for both "Aged 17 years and younger" and "Aged 17 years and under" conditions. The `TRUE ~ age_group` part ensures that if none of the specified conditions match, the original value is retained. Adjust it according to your specific needs.

knitr::kable(
  list(table1, table2),
  caption = "Total Arrest vs Total Booked for Ethnic and Identity Based Groups for the year 2020, and 2021",
  col.names = c("Ethinic and Identity Based Groups", "2020", "2021"),
  booktabs = TRUE,
  valign = "top"
)

is this correct?


ChatGPT:

The code you provided is close, but there is a small error in the col.names argument. The column names should match the number of columns in your tables. Assuming both table1 and table2 have three columns, the correct code would be:

knitr::kable(
  list(table1, table2),
  caption = "Total Arrest vs Total Booked for Ethnic and Identity Based Groups for the year 2020, and 2021",
  col.names = c("Ethinic and Identity Based Groups", "2020", "2021"),
  booktabs = TRUE,
  valign = "top"
)
Make sure to check that both table1 and table2 have three columns each, and adjust the col.names accordingly. If the tables have a different number of columns, you need to adjust the col.names accordingly.

In a recent article published Toronto Police Services it is highlighted that "Black, East/Southeast Asian, Middle Eastern and Latino people were over-represented in reported use of force incidents compared to their presence in the enforcement action population." (@Fanfair2022) indicating that even though Toronto Police Services has been working towards a more equitable society, however there are still hints of racial bias in the arrests made by the Toronto Police Services. As we embark on this exploration, the data prompts critical questions about the socio-cultural, economic, and systemic factors that contribute to these observed patterns. This paper aims to contribute to a nuanced understanding of the dynamics of arrests in Toronto, providing insights that can inform targeted interventions, policy considerations, and community engagement efforts.

Table 1 (a) (@tbl-table1) provides a summary of our data, revealing the number of individuals arrested from each prominent ethnic group in the years 2020 and 2021. Table 2 (b) shows out-of all the people arrested from each ethinic idenitiy how many were actually booked under a criminal case.

ggplot(table3_ii, aes(x = age_group, y = value, color = perceived_race)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ year, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot for the number of arrests by Age-Group for the year 2021",
       x = "Age Group",
       y = "Value",
       fill = "Perceived Race") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

add label to point
To add labels to the points in your scatter plot, you can use the `geom_text()` function. Here's the modified code:

```R
# Assuming you have already created table3_ii as mentioned in your previous code

# Create a scatter plot with labels
ggplot(table3_ii, aes(x = age_group, y = value, color = perceived_race, label = perceived_race)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(hjust = 1, vjust = 1.5) +  # Adjust the hjust and vjust as needed
  facet_wrap(~ year, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot for the number of arrests by Age-Group for the year 2021",
       x = "Age Group",
       y = "Value",
       color = "Perceived Race") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

In this code:

- I added `label = perceived_race` to the `aes()` function to specify the variable for labels.
- I included `geom_text()` to display the labels. You can adjust the `hjust` and `vjust` parameters to control the position of the labels relative to the points.

This should add labels to each point in your scatter plot based on the `perceived_race` variable.
